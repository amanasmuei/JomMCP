## 🔧 Updated Configurations

### 1. pyproject.toml
- ✅ Updated package paths to reflect new structure
- ✅ Updated test paths and coverage settings
- ✅ Enhanced project metadata and classification
- ✅ Improved isort and mypy configurations

### 2. Test Configuration
- ✅ Centralized test configuration in `config/testing/`
- ✅ Organized tests by type (unit, integration, e2e, performance)
- ✅ Updated coverage settings for new directory structure

### 3. Documentation
- ✅ Comprehensive README with new structure
- ✅ Testing guide in `tests/README.md`
- ✅ Deployment guide in `docs/deployment/README.md`

## 🚀 Next Steps for Developers

### To start developing:

1. **Update import paths** in your code to reflect new structure:
   ```python
   # Old imports
   from core.config import settings
   from registration_service.models import User
   
   # New imports
   from packages.core.config import settings
   from apps.registration_service.models import User
   ```

2. **Update development commands**:
   ```bash
   # Start services with new paths
   PYTHONPATH=packages:apps python apps/api-gateway/main.py
   
   # Run tests
   pytest tests/ -v
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r config/requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Use Docker for development**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```
